							My school computer administrators installed an extension on our chromebooks. GoGuardian. *cue ominous music*
							Before this horrible event, the only thing blocking us from .io and buzzfeed, etc. was chrominium m. There’s a neat little trick you can do there- at chrome://inspect, chrominium m had an inspect option. Type in window.close() into the console, and the entire extension would shut down. FREEDOM!
							Until I restarted my chromebook one day. It updated… And I couldn’t do this trick anymore. WHY? JUST WHY?
							I did a little investigation on GoGuardian. Tailor-made to torture students with chromebooks. I tried finding out a way to get into the school administrators’ accounts. No luck. chrome://extensions? Nope. It was force-installed with no way (that I know of) of deleting it.
							Now, during lessons I realised that students would go to boredbutton.com, which is somehow not blocked. And in bored button, you could play games (that are usually blocked) within the bored button frame. So I went to inspect the HTML code.
